<h1>Best Animes of All Time</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Animes</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>It's a nostalgic anime and quite a sad one</p>
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>The first parts were great the last one wasn't so great</p>
<h3>Hunter X Hunter</h3>
<p>It's also a very nostalgic anime back from my childhood that's why I love it so much</p>
